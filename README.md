# ColorImproviser

## Overall Project
The overall goal of this project is to utilize color as a tool to teach students how to play the blues with an intuitive interface.
We intend to teach beginning theory students how the 12-bar blues form is constructed using a colorful display, a backing track for
improvisation, as well as a trumpet .wav files to improvise with. 

## How it works
On the display, the key that the backing track is being played in is shown on the bottom-left corner. On the left-hand side of the screen
are the I7, IV7, V7 chords and blues scale labels which construct the basic blues form. All the dominant7 chords contain the notes in the
mixolydian scale to the right of them, whereas the blues scale is present to the right of its label. As the music plays, each dominant7
chord lights up when it is being played in the backing track. Each row is mapped to a specific row on the keyboard, and thus students can 
play each note mapped to its respective keyID. When a note is played, it also becomes highlighted.

## Project Goals
We hope that by using this colorful interface, students will build stronger connections in their brains when seeing which notes belong to
which chords, and which notes are common amongst different chords in the blues form. Also, this would be a useful for building 
an aural and rhythmic relationship with the blues form.
